# Welcome {#welcome}

Hello,

We wanted to give you a taste of what our project is going to look like. We decided to use our original proposal document (with some adjustments and updates) to do so. We divided each section into chapters, so the reader can appreciate the overall structure of a book. 

We are currently working on our project re-scoping and the structure of the chapters. 

Enjoy the test drive!
