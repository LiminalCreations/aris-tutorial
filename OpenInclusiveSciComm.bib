Although approaches to implementing IEAs are context-specific, challenges in data acquisition, management, processing, analysis, and communication are universal. By embracing open science, in which scientific data, methods, and products are made publicly accessible, along with the ever-expanding tools facilitating open science, IEA practitioners will be better equipped to address these challenges. Here, we provide a snapshot of the state of open science practices in IEAs on-going across the United States. We show that open science has improved the flexibility, reproducibility, and efficiency of the scientific workflows within the IEA framework. Although the initial time investment necessary for developing open science workflows may appear daunting, we show that the subsequent returns provided by the efficient and transparent development of IEA products are worth the effort. By improving the implementation of IEAs, open science tools and principals have the potential to further Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) worldwide.},

In addition to communication variables, this model incorporates the notion of domain-specific pathways as determinants of attitudinal and cognitive outcomes. As a case study, the model is applied to salience of climate change, and the results reveal evidence for the mediation of media effects on salience through interpersonal discussion. Moreover, two domain-specific communication pathways?one focusing on politics and the other on science?have differential impacts on the outcome. These results are discussed in terms of integrating interpersonal communication into existing models of public perceptions of science controversy.},

This study investigates why individuals contribute information to DKRs by applying and extending transactive memory theory. Data from knowledge workers (N = 208) nested in work groups (J = 17) located in Europe and the United States revealed, consistent with transactive memory theory, that perceptions of experts' retrieval of information were positively related to the likelihood of information provision to DKRs. The relationship between experts' perceptions of retrieval and information provision varied from group to group, and cross-level interactions indicated that trust in how the information would be used and the interdependence of tasks within groups could explain that variation. Furthermore, information provision to DKRs was related to communication networks in ways consistent with theorizing regarding the formation of transactive memory systems. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, emphasizing the utility of multilevel approaches for conceptualizing and modeling why individuals provide information to DKRs.},

We formulate a temporal notion of ``distance'' in the underlying social network by measuring the minimum time required for information to spread from one node to another \textemdash{} a concept that draws on the notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and long-range bridges \textemdash{} a finding that sheds new light on the relationship between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.},

We describe an ambassador approach, to develop a scientist's impact identity, which integrates his or her research, personal interests and experiences to achieve societal impacts. The scientist identifies a community or focal group to engage, on the basis of his or her impact identity, learns about that group, and promotes inclusion of all group members by engaging in venues in which that group naturally gathers, rather than in traditional education settings. Focal group members stated that scientists communicated effectively and were responsive to participant questions and ideas. Scientists reported professional and personal benefits from this approach.},

While LaTeX, a plain-text-based document preparation system, has been considered an accessible full-fledged authoring and reference management tool, its steep learning curve and limited output type to PDF have made some blind people, who lack programming background and/or who would like to produce different accessible output formats, discouraged.

This research has developed and detailed the Accessible RMarkdown Online Writer (AROW) as a hands-on demonstration that proves its capability for highly accessible scientific document production that can be done by a blind individual in multiple formats including Word, RTF, PDF, MathML/MathJax enabled HTML, and presentations.},

  abstract = {Guided by an integrated theoretical approach combining communication infrastructure theory with methods of assets-oriented community field mapping, this study reports the findings of an engaged scholarship project we term communication asset mapping (CAM). Ecological in orientation and participatory in practice, CAM represents a tool for analyzing urban spaces' potential as mediums for building healthy communities. This article offers two case studies from different low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles, the first a researcher-directed CAM application and the second undertaken in collaboration with community health promotion workers. Both offer insights for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersecting roles of communication and place in creating positive community change.},

In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:  the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  the nature of the copyrighted work;  the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; \&amp;  the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.   The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors. In accord with these provisions, the  International Journal of Communication  believes in the vigorous assertion and defense of Fair Use by scholars engaged in academic research, teaching and non-commercial publishing. Thus, we view the inclusion of ``quotations'' from existing print, visual, audio and audio-visual texts to be appropriate examples of Fair Use, as are reproductions of visual images for the purpose of scholarly analysis. We encourage authors to obtain appropriate permissions to use materials originally produced by others, but do not require such permissions as long as the usage of such materials falls within the boundaries of Fair Use.  The  International Journal of Communication  encourages authors to employ fair use in their scholarly publishing wherever appropriate. Fair use is the right to use unlicensed copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your own work, in some circumstances. We consult the  Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication , created by the International Communication Association and endorsed by the National Communication Association, and you should too. If you have any questions about whether fair use applies to your uses of copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your scholarship, simply include your rationale, grounded in the Best Practices, as a supplementary document with your submission.},

  abstract = {Since 1997, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) efforts to promote the Broader Impacts Criterion (BIC) have yielded mixed results. Here, we evaluate proposals to the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) from submission through the reporting stage to assess DEB's implementation of the BIC. Our results suggest that within DEB, past principal investigators have tended to underreport broader impact activities, and past reviewers have paid them less attention than intellectual merit activities. Activities targeting broadening participation of underrepresented groups were particularly rare in all of the document types that we examined (i.e., proposals, panel summaries, and reports). In 2013, the NSF overhauled the review and reporting processes and recommended institutional links to promote the BIC. By examining both the mechanics of the Broader Impacts Criterion and the policy setting within which it has been implemented we hope to contribute to efforts to clarify the broader impacts concept and improve its effectiveness.},
